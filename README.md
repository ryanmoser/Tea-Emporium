# Tea Emporium
Used for 3 friends to donate tea to a shared pool. 
First select which user you are (names will have to be edited in the source code.
When donating, use the donate tab to insert the number of teabags and the total price.
  this user will be credited with an equivalent number of credits to spend on other tea flavors (or their own).
The xml found in the data folder must be present in order for the program to work.
  Rebuilding the project in unity will remove the xml files from the DGTE_DATA folder - backup copies are found in the Assets folder.
